# Introduction
Netflix is one of the largest streaming service providers that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries and more – on thousands of internet-connected devices. Their reach is across the globe from US to China, and Australia to India.
# Problem Statement
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

In this analysis, we will explore netflix dataset through visualizations and graphs using python libraries. Will apply different unsupervised clustering techniques to predict the output.
# In this project, you are required to do
Exploratory Data Analysis, Understanding what type content is available, Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years, lustering similar content by matching text-based features and etc.
